Belly Button Biodiversity is a project done by Dan Fergus and Sara Council in 2011 to study the 
microbes that inhabit belly buttons. With the data that they have collected, I have used Plotly.js
to build interactice charts to showcase the results from all the participants. 

The pie chart shows the top 10 microbes from each participant and the bubble chart displays 
all the microbes from each participant along with the counts.
